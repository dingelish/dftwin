Installation
============

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Extract the latest Pin build. Assuming that it was extracted in
     `/usr/src/pin', we shall refer to that path as Pin's root path
      from now on

  2. Type `export PIN_HOME=/usr/src/pin' to set the environment
     variable PIN_HOME to the root path of Pin. Replace `/usr/src/pin'
     with *your* root path
  
  3. `cd' to the directory src/, which contains the source code of libdft,
     and type `make' to compile the package (i.e., the libdft library)

  4. `cd' to the directory tools/ and type `make tools' to compile the
     accompanying tools (e.g., nullpin, libdft, libdft-dta, etc.)

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from src/
     and tools/ by typing `make clean' on the respective directory
