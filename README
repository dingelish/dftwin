dftwin provides high performance dynamic data flow tracking on windows, especially useful for program analysis for various purposes. dftwin is originally a windows port for libdft, which is a Dynamic data flow tracking (DFT) library on linux. Afterwards, dftwin fixes bugs for libdft, and adds some new features such as shadow stack maintenance.
