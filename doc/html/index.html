Introduction</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
Pin is a tool for the instrumentation of programs. It supports the Android*, Linux*, OSX* and Windows* operating systems and executables for the IA-32, Intel(R) 64 architectures.<p>
Pin allows a tool to insert arbitrary code (written in C or C++) in arbitrary places in the executable. The code is added dynamically while the executable is running. This also makes it possible to attach Pin to an already running process.<p>
Pin provides a rich API that abstracts away the underlying instruction set idiosyncracies and allows context information such as register contents to be passed to the injected code as parameters. Pin automatically saves and restores the registers that are overwritten by the injected code so the application continues to work. Limited access to symbol and debug information is available as well.<p>
Pin includes the source code for a large number of example instrumentation tools like basic block profilers, cache simulators, instruction trace generators, etc. It is easy to derive new tools using the examples as a template.<p>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="Pin">
Pin</a></h3>
The best way to think about Pin is as a "just in time" (JIT) compiler. The input to this compiler is not bytecode, however, but a regular executable. Pin intercepts the execution of the first instruction of the executable and generates ("compiles") new code for the straight line code sequence starting at this instruction. It then transfers control to the generated sequence. The generated code sequence is almost identical to the original one, but Pin ensures that it regains control when a branch exits the sequence. After regaining control, Pin generates more code for the branch target and continues execution. Pin makes this efficient by keeping all of the generated code in memory so it can be reused and directly branching from one sequence to another.<p>
In JIT mode, the only code ever executed is the generated code. The original code is only used for reference. When generating code, Pin gives the user an opportunity to inject their own code (instrumentation).<p>
Pin instruments all instructions that are actually excuted. It does not matter in what section they reside. Although there are some exceptions for conditional branches, generally speaking, if an instruction is never executed then it will not be instrumented.<h3><a class="anchor" name="Pintools">
Pintools</a></h3>
Conceptually, instrumentation consists of two components:<p>
<ul>
<li>A mechanism that decides where and what code is inserted</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The code to execute at insertion points</li></ul>
<p>
These two components are <em>instrumentation</em> and <em>analysis</em> code. Both components live in a single executable, a <em>Pintool</em>. Pintools can be thought of as plugins that can modify the code generation process inside Pin.<p>
The Pintool registers instrumentation callback routines with Pin that are called from Pin whenever new code needs to be generated. This instrumentation callback routine represents the instrumentation component. It inspects the code to be generated, investigates its static properties, and decides if and where to inject calls to analysis functions.<p>
The analysis function gathers data about the application. Pin makes sure that the integer and floating point register state is saved and restored as necessary and allow arguments to be passed to the functions.<p>
The Pintool can also register notification callback routines for events such as thread creation or forking. These callbacks are generally used to gather data or tool initialization or clean up.<h3><a class="anchor" name="Observations">
Observations</a></h3>
Since a Pintool works like a plugin, it must run in the same address space as Pin and the executable to be instrumented. Hence the Pintool has access to all of the executable's data. It also shares file descriptors and other process information with the executable.<p>
Pin and the Pintool control a program starting with the very first instruction. For executables compiled with shared libraries this implies that the execution of the dynamic loader and all shared libraries will be visible to the Pintool.<p>
When writing tools, it is more important to tune the analysis code than the instrumentation code. This is because the instrumentation is executed once, but analysis code is called many times.<h3><a class="anchor" name="GRAN">
Instrumentation Granularity</a></h3>
As described above, Pin's instrumentation is "just in time" (JIT). Instrumentation occurs immediately before a code sequence is executed for the first time. We call this mode of operation <em> trace instrumentation </em>.<p>
Trace instrumentation lets the Pintool inspect and instrument an executable one trace at a time. Traces usually begin at the target of a taken branch and end with an unconditional branch, including calls and returns. Pin guarantees that a trace is only entered at the top, but it may contain multiple exits. If a branch joins the middle of a trace, Pin constructs a new trace that begins with the branch target. Pin breaks the trace into basic blocks, <em>BBLs</em>. A BBL is a single entrance, single exit sequence of instructions. Branches to the middle of a bbl begin a new trace and hence a new BBL. It is often possible to insert a single analysis call for a BBL, instead of one analysis call for every instruction. Reducing the number of analysis calls makes instrumentation more efficient. Trace instrumentation utilizes the TRACE_AddInstrumentFunction API call.<p>
Note, though, that since Pin is discovering the control flow of the program dynamically as it executes, Pin's BBL can be different from the classical definition of a BBL which you will find in a compiler textbook. For instance, consider the code generated for the body of a switch statement like this <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">    <span class="keywordflow">switch</span>(i)
    {
        <span class="keywordflow">case</span> 4: total++;
        <span class="keywordflow">case</span> 3: total++;
        <span class="keywordflow">case</span> 2: total++;
        <span class="keywordflow">case</span> 1: total++;
        <span class="keywordflow">case</span> 0:
        <span class="keywordflow">default</span>: <span class="keywordflow">break</span>;
    }
</pre></div><p>
It will generate instructions something like this (for the IA-32 architecture) <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">.L7:
        addl    $1, -4(%ebp)
.L6:
        addl    $1, -4(%ebp)
.L5:
        addl    $1, -4(%ebp)
.L4:
        addl    $1, -4(%ebp)
</pre></div><p>
In terms of classical basic blocks, each addl instruction is in a single instruction basic block. However as the different switch cases are executed, Pin will generate BBLs which contain all four instructions (when the .L7 case is entered), three instructions (when the .L6 case is entered), and so on. This means that counting Pin BBLs is unlikely to give the count you would expect if you thought that Pin BBLs were the same as the basic blocks in the text book. Here, for instance, if the code branches to .L7 you will count one Pin BBL, but there are four classical basic blocks executed.<p>
Pin also breaks BBLs on some other instructions which may be unexpected, for instance (on IA-32 and Intel 64 architectures) cpuid, popf and REP prefixed instructions all end traces and therefore BBLs. Since REP prefixed instructions are treated as implicit loops, if a REP prefixed instruction iterates more than once, iterations after the first will cause a single instruction BBL to be generated, so in this case you would see more basic blocks executed than you might expect.<p>
As a convenience for Pintool writers, Pin also offers an <em> instruction instrumentation </em> mode which lets the tool inspect and instrument an executable a single instruction at a time. This is essentially identical to trace instrumentation where the Pintool writer has been freed from the responsibilty of iterating over the instructions inside a trace. As decribed under trace instrumentation, certain BBLs and the instructions inside of them may be generated (and hence instrumented) multiple times. Instruction instrumentation utilizes the INS_AddInstrumentFunction API call.<p>
Sometimes, however, it can be useful to look at different granularity than a trace. For this purpose Pin offers two additional modes: image and routine instrumentation. These modes are implemented by "caching" instrumentation requests and hence incur a space overhead, these modes are aslo referred to as ahead-of-time instrumentation.<p>
Image instrumentation lets the Pintool inspect and instrument an entire image, IMG, when it is first loaded. A Pintool can walk the sections, SEC, of the image, the routines, RTN, of a section, and the instructions, INS of a routine. Instrumentation can be inserted so that it is executed before or after a routine is executed, or before or after an instruction is executed. Image instrumentation utilizes the IMG_AddInstrumentFunction API call. Image instrumentation depends on symbol information to determine routine boundaries hence PIN_InitSymbols must be called before PIN_Init.<p>
Routine instrumentation lets the Pintool inspect and instrument an entire routine when the image it is contained in is first loaded. A Pintool can walk the instructions of a routine. There is not enough information available to break the instructions into BBLs. Instrumentation can be inserted so that it is executed before or after a routine is executed, or before or after an instruction is executed. Routine instrumentation is provided as a convenience for Pintool writers, as an alternative to walking the sections and routines of the image during the Image instrumentation, as described in the previous paragraph.<p>
Routine instrumentation utilizes the RTN_AddInstrumentFunction API call. Instrumentation of routine exits does not work reliably in the presence of tail calls or when return instructions cannot reliably be detected.<p>
Note that in both Image and Routine instrumentation, it is not possible to know whether or not a routine will actually be executed (since these instrumentations are done at image load time). It is possible to walk the instructions only of routines that are executed, in the Trace or Instruction instrumentation routines, by identifying instructions that are the start of routines. See the tool Tests/parse_executed_rtns.cpp.<h3><a class="anchor" name="SYMBOLS">
Symbols</a></h3>
Pin provides access to function names using the symbol object (SYM). Symbol objects only provide information about the function symbols in the application. Information about other types of symbols (e.g. data symbols), must be obtained independently by the tool.<p>
On Windows, you can use dbghelp.dll for this. Note that using dbghelp.dll in an instrumented process is not safe and can cause dead-locks in some cases. A possible solution is to find symbols using a different non-instrumented process.<p>
On Linux, libelf.so or libdwarf.so can be used to access symbol information.<p>
PIN_InitSymbols must be called to access functions by name. See <a class="el" href="group__SYM__BASIC__API.html">SYM: Symbol Object</a> for more information.<h3><a class="anchor" name="FP">
Floating Point Support in Analysis Routines</a></h3>
Pin takes care of maintaining the application's floating point state accross analysis routines.<p>
IARG_REG_VALUE cannot be used to pass floating point register values as arguments to analysis routines.<h3><a class="anchor" name="MT">
Instrumenting Multi-threaded Applications</a></h3>
Instrumenting a multi-threaded program requires that the tool be thread safe - access to global storage must be coordinated with other threads. Pin tries to provide a conventional C++ program environment for tools, but it is not possible to use the standard library interfaces to manage threads in a Pintool. For example, Linux tools cannot use the pthreads library and Windows tools should not use the Win32 API's to manage threads. Instead, Pin provides its own locking and thread management API's, which the Pintool should use. (See <a class="el" href="group__LOCK.html">LOCK: Locking Primitives</a> and <a class="el" href="group__PIN__THREAD__API.html">Pin Thread API</a>.)<p>
Pintools do not need to add explicit locking to instrumentation routines because Pin calls these routines while holding an internal lock called the VM lock. However, Pin does execute analysis and replacement functions in parallel, so Pintools may need to add locking to these routines if they access global data.<p>
Pintools on Linux also need to take care when calling standard C or C++ library routines from analysis or replacement functions because the C and C++ libraries linked into Pintools are <b>not</b> thread-safe. Some simple C / C++ routines are safe to call without locking, because their implementations are inherently thread-safe, however, Pin does not attempt to provide a list of safe routines. If you are in doubt, you should add locking around calls to library functions. In particular, the "errno" value is not multi-thread safe, so tools that use this should provide their own locking. Note that these restrictions only exist on the Unix platforms, as the library routines on Windows are thread safe.<p>
Pin provides call-backs when each thread starts and ends (see PIN_AddThreadStartFunction and PIN_AddThreadFiniFunction). These provide a convenient place for a Pintool to allocate and manipulate thread local data and store it on a thread's local storage.<p>
Pin also provides an analysis routine argument (IARG_THREAD_ID), which passes a Pin-specific thread ID for the calling thread. This ID is different from the O/S system thread ID, and is a small number starting at 0, which can be used as an index to an array of thread data or as the locking value to Pin user locks. See the example <a class="el" href="index.html#MallocMT">Instrumenting Threaded Applications</a> for more information.<p>
In addition to the Pin thread ID, the Pin API provides an efficient thread local storage (TLS), with the option to allocate a new TLS key and associate it with a given data destruction function. Any thread of the process can store and retrieve values in its own slot, referenced by the allocated key. The initial value associated with the key in all threads is NULL. See the example <a class="el" href="index.html#InscountTLS">Using TLS</a> for more information.<p>
False sharing occurs when multiple threads access different parts of the same cache line and at least one of them is a write. To maintain memory coherency, the computer must copy the memory from one CPU's cache to another, even though data is not truly shared. False sharing can usually be avoided by padding critical data structures to the size of a cache line, or by rearranging the data layout of structures. See the example <a class="el" href="index.html#InscountTLS">Using TLS</a> for more information.<h3><a class="anchor" name="Deadlock">
Avoiding Deadlocks in Multi-threaded Applications</a></h3>
Since Pin, the tool, and the application may each acquire and release locks, Pin tool developers must take care to avoid deadlocks with either the application or Pin. Deadlocks generally occur when two threads acquire the same locks in a different order. For example, thread A acquires lock L1 and then acquires lock L2, while thread B acquires lock L2 and then acquires lock L1. This will lead to a deadlock if thread A holds lock L1 and waits for L2 while thread B holds lock L2 and waits for L1. To avoid such deadlocks, Pin imposes a hierarchy on the order in which locks must be acquired. Pin generally acquires its own internal locks before the tool acquires any lock (e.g. via <a class="el" href="group__LOCK.html#gcb584611ae773c582d79d075adbe9bee">GetLock()</a>). Additionally, we assume that the application may acquire locks at the top of this hierarchy (i.e. before Pin acquires its internal locks). The following diagram illustrates the hierarchy: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
Application locks -&gt; Pin internal locks -&gt; Tool locks
</pre></div> Pin tool developers should design their Pin tools such that they never break this lock hierarchy, and they can do so by following these basic guidelines:<ul>
<li>If the tool acquires any locks from within a Pin call-back, it must release those locks before returning from that call-back. Holding a lock across Pin call-backs violates the hierarchy with respect to the Pin internal locks.</li><li>If the tool acquires any locks from within an analysis routine, it must release those locks before returning from the analysis routine. Holding a lock across Pin analysis routines violates the hierarchy with respect to Pin internal locks and other locks used by the instrumented application itself.</li><li>If the tool calls a Pin API from within a Pin call-back or analysis routine, it should not hold any tool locks when calling the API. Some of the Pin APIs use the internal Pin locks so holding a tool lock before invoking these APIs violates the hierarchy with respect to the Pin internal locks.</li><li>If the tool calls a Pin API from within an analysis routine, it may need to acquire the Pin client lock first by calling <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#gdf5abd51ee9b1d599c539a9e2784e9ef">PIN_LockClient()</a>. This depends on the API, so check the documentation for the specific API for more information. Note that the tool should not hold any other locks when calling <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#gdf5abd51ee9b1d599c539a9e2784e9ef">PIN_LockClient()</a>, as described in the previous item.</li></ul>
<p>
While these guidelines are sufficient in most cases, they may turn out to be too restrictive for certain use-cases. The next set of guidelines explains the conditions in which it is safe to relax the basic guidelines above:<ul>
<li>In JIT mode, the tool may acquire locks from within an analysis routine and not release them, providing it releases these locks before leaving the trace that contains the analysis routine. The tool must expect that the trace may exit "early" if an application instruction raises an exception. Any lock <code>L</code>, which the tool might hold when the application raises an exception, must obey the following sub-rules:<ul>
<li>The tool must establish a call-back that executes when the application raises an exception and this call-back must release lock <code>L</code> if it was acquired at the time the exception occurred. Tools can use <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#g31e63e96b8663350d196e9680b3f2b92">PIN_AddContextChangeFunction()</a> to establish this call-back.</li><li>The tool must not acquire lock <code>L</code> from within any Pin call-back, to avoid violating the hierarchy with respect to the Pin internal locks.</li></ul>
</li><li>If the tool calls a Pin API from an analysis routine, it may acquire and hold a lock <code>L</code> while calling the API providing that:<ul>
<li>Lock <code>L</code> is not being acquired from any Pin call-back. This avoids the hierarchy violation with respect to the Pin internal locks.</li><li>The Pin API being invoked does not cause application code to execute (e.g., <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#gf5807146670d39bc546a7f4826b52cc0">PIN_CallApplicationFunction()</a>). This avoids the hierarchy violation with respect to the locks used by the application itself.</li></ul>
</li></ul>

Instruction Address Trace (Instruction Instrumentation)</a></h3>
In the previous example, we did not pass any arguments to <code>docount</code>, the analysis procedure. In this example, we show how to pass arguments. When calling an analysis procedure, Pin allows you to pass the instruction pointer, current value of registers, effective address of memory operations, constants, etc. For a complete list, see <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#g089c27ca15e9ff139dd3a3f8a6f8451d">IARG_TYPE</a>.<p>
With a small change, we can turn the instruction counting example into a Pintool that prints the address of every instruction that is executed. This tool is useful for understanding the control flow of a program for debugging, or in processor design when simulating an instruction cache.<p>
We change the arguments to INS_InsertCall to pass the address of the instruction about to be executed. We replace <code>docount</code> with <code>printip</code>, which prints the instruction address. It writes its output to the file <code>itrace.out</code>.<p>
This is how to run it and look at the output:<p>

</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="MAddressTrace">
Memory Reference Trace (Instruction Instrumentation)</a></h3>
The previous example instruments all instructions. Sometimes a tool may only want to instrument a class of instructions, like memory operations or branch instructions. A tool can do this by using the Pin API which includes functions that classify and examine instructions. The basic API is common to all instruction sets and is described <a class="el" href="group__INS__BASIC__API.html">here.</a> In addition, there is an instruction set specific API for the <a class="el" href="group__INS__BASIC__API__IA32.html">IA-32 ISA.</a><p>
In this example, we show how to do more selective instrumentation by examining the instructions. This tool generates a trace of all memory addresses referenced by a program. This is also useful for debugging and for simulating a data cache in a processor.<p>
We only instrument instructions that read or write memory. We also use INS_InsertPredicatedCall instead of INS_InsertCall to avoid generating references to instructions that are predicated when the predicate is false. On IA-32 and Intel 64 architectures CMOVcc, FCMOVcc and REP prefixed string operations are treated as being predicated. For CMOVcc and FCMOVcc the predicate is the condition test implied by "cc", for REP prefixed string ops it is that the count register is non-zero.<p>
Since the instrumentation functions are only called once and the analysis functions are called every time an instruction is executed, it is much faster to instrument only the memory operations, as compared to the previous instruction trace example that instruments every instruction.<p>
Here is how to run it and the sample output:<p>

</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="SafeCopy">
Using PIN_SafeCopy()</a></h3>
PIN_SafeCopy is used to copy the specified number of bytes from a source memory region to a destination memory region. This function guarantees safe return to the caller even if the source or destination regions are inaccessible (entirely or partially).<p>
Use of this function also guarantees that the tool reads or writes the values used by the application. For example, on Windows, Pin replaces certain TEB fields when running a tool's analysis code. If the tool accessed these fields directly, it would see the modified values rather than the original ones. Using <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#g98669d2f5629027689d60bd852ffa0eb">PIN_SafeCopy()</a> allows the tool to read or write the application's values for these fields.<p>
We recommend using this API any time a tool reads or writes application memory.<p>

Order of Instrumentation</a></h3>
Pin provides tools with multiple ways to control the exection order of analysis calls. The exection order depends mainly on the insertion action (<a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#g707ea08e31f44f4a81e2a7766123bad7">IPOINT</a>) and call order (<a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#g3d1d5f6805cb16d00bce441290ca2212">CALL_ORDER</a>). The example below illustrates this behavior by instrumenting all return instructions in three different ways. Additional examples can be found in source/tools/InstrumentationOrderAndVersion.<p>

Instrumenting Threaded Applications</a></h3>
The following example demonstrates using the ThreadStart() and ThreadFini() notification callbacks. Although ThreadStart() and ThreadFini() are executed under the VM and client locks, they could still contend with resources that are shared by other analysis routines. Using PIN_GetLock() prevents this.<p>
Note that there is known isolation issue when using Pin on Windows. On Windows, a deadlock can occur if a tool opens a file in a callback when run on a multi-threaded application. To work around this problem, open one file in main, and tag the data with the thread ID. See source/tools/ManualExamples/buffer-win.cpp as an example. This problem does not exist on Linux.<p>

</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="Buffering">
Using the Fast Buffering APIs</a></h3>
Pin provides support for buffering data for processing. If all that your analysis callback does is to store its arguments into a buffer, then you should be able to use the buffering API instead, with some performance benefit. <a class="el" href="group__BUFFER__API.html#g008bd698d07658fc4f60fd9b61fb81bc">PIN_DefineTraceBuffer()</a> defines the buffer that will be used. The buffer is allocated by each thread when it starts up, and deallocated when the thread exits. <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#gcf731514b88f79344068df5d8e60eacc">INS_InsertFillBuffer()</a> writes the requested data directly to the given buffer. The callback delineated in the <a class="el" href="group__BUFFER__API.html#g008bd698d07658fc4f60fd9b61fb81bc">PIN_DefineTraceBuffer()</a> call is used to process the buffer when the buffer is nearly full, and when the thread exits. Pin does <b>not</b> serialize the calls to this callback, so it is the tool writers responsibilty to make sure this function is thread safe. This example records the PC of all instructions that access memory, and the effective address accessed by the instruction. Note that IARG_REG_REFERENCE, IARG_REG_CONST_REFERENCE and IARG_CONTEXT can NOT be used in the Fast Buffering APIs<p>

</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="ReplaceSigProbed">
Replacing a Routine in Probe Mode</a></h3>
Probe mode is a method of using Pin to insert probes at the start of specified routines. A probe is a jump instruction that is placed at the start of the specified routine. The probe redirects the flow of control to the replacement function. Before the probe is inserted, the first few instructions of the specified routine are relocated. It is not uncommon for the replacement function to call the replaced routine. Pin provides the relocated address to facilate this. See the example below.<p>
In probe mode, the application and the replacement routine are run natively. This improves performance, but it puts more responsibility on the tool writer. Probes can only be placed on RTN boundaries.<p>
Many of the PIN APIs that are available in JIT mode are not applicable in Probe mode. In particular, the Pin thread APIs are not supported in Probe mode, because Pin has no information about the threads when the application is run natively. For more information, check the RTN API documentation.<p>
The tool writer must guarantee that there is no jump target where the probe is placed. A probe may be up to 14 bytes long.<p>
Also, it is the tool writer's responsibility to ensure that no thread is currently executing the code where a probe is inserted. Tool writers are encouraged to insert probes when an image is loaded to avoid this problem. Pin will automatically remove the probes when an image is unloaded.<p>
When using probes, Pin must be started with the <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#g01a31bf221500b0ca0b97fb64cc62247">PIN_StartProgramProbed()</a> API.<p>
Additional libraries must be installed to use Probe mode. See <a class="el" href="index.html#LIBRARIES">Libraries for Linux</a> for further information.<p>

======================================================================================== <h2><a class="anchor" name="CALLBACK">
Callbacks</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
The examples in the previous section have introduced a number of ways to register callback functions via the Pin API, such as:<p>
<ul>
<li>INS_AddInstrumentFunction (INSCALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li><li>TRACE_AddInstrumentFunction (TRACECALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li><li>RTN_AddInstrumentFunction (RTNCALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li><li>IMG_AddInstrumentFunction (IMGCALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li><li>PIN_AddFiniFunction (FINICALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li><li>PIN_AddDetachFunction (DETACHCALLBACK fun, VOID *val)</li></ul>
<p>
The extra parameter <code>val</code> (shared by all the registration functions) will be passed to <code>fun</code> as its second argument whenever it is "called back". This is a standard mechanism used in GUI programming with callbacks.<p>
If this feature is not needed, it is safe to pass 0 for <code>val</code> when registering a callback. The expected use of <code>val</code> is to pass a pointer to an instance of a class. Since <code>val</code> is a generic pointer, <code>fun</code> must cast it back to an object before dereferencing the pointer.<p>
======================================================================================== <h2><a class="anchor" name="MODIFYING">
Modifying Application Instructions</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
Although Pin is most commonly used for instrumenting applications, it is also possible to change the application's instructions. The simplest way to do this is to insert an analysis routine to emulate an instruction, and then use <a class="el" href="group__INS__MOD__API__GEN__IA32.html#gd37791f157338a12e22f8d9c54f09fe4">INS_Delete()</a> to remove the original instruction. It is also possible to insert direct or indirect branches (using INS_InsertDirectJump and INS_InsertIndirectJump), which makes it easier to emulate instructions that change the control flow.<p>
The memory addresses accessed by an instruction can be modified to refer to a value calculated by an analysis routine using INS_RewriteMemoryOperand.<p>
Note that in all of the cases where an instruction is modified, the modification is only made after all of the instrumentation routines have been executed. Therefore all of the instrumentation routines see the original, un-modified instruction.<p>
======================================================================================== <h2><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG">
The Pin Advanced Debugging Extensions</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
Pin's advanced debugging extensions allow you to debug an application, even while it runs under Pin. Moreover, your Pin tool can add support for new debugger commands, without making any changes to GDB or Visual Studio. This allows you to interactively control your Pin tool from within a live debugger session. Finally, Pin tools can add powerful new debugger features that are enabled via instrumentation. For example, a Pin tool can use instrumentation to look for an interesting condition (like a memory buffer overwrite) and then stop at a live debugger session when that condition occurs.<p>
This section illustrates these three concepts:<p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling all the traditional debugger features even while running an application under Pin.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing new debugger commands in your Pin tool to allow interactive control of the tool from a live debugger session.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Adding support for new debugger features by writing a Pin tool.</li></ul>
<p>
These features are available on both Linux (using GDB) and on Windows (using Visual Studio). The Pin APIs are the same in both cases, but their usage from within the debugger is different because each debugger has a different UI. The following tutorial is divided into two sections: one that is Linux centric and another that is Windows centric. They both describe the same example, so you can continue by reading either section.<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="index.html#APPDEBUG_LINUX">Tutorial for Linux</a></li><li><a class="el" href="index.html#APPDEBUG_WINDOWS">Tutorial for Windows</a></li></ul>
<p>
Finally, note that these advanced debugging extensions are not at all related to debugging your Pintool. If you have a bug in your tool and need to debug it, see the section <a class="el" href="index.html#DEBUGGING">Tips for Debugging a Pintool</a> instead.<h3><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG_LINUX">
Advanced Debugging Extensions on Linux</a></h3>
Pin's debugging extensions on Linux work with nearly all modern versions of GDB, so you can probably use whatever version of GDB is already installed on your system. Pin uses GDB's remote debugger features, so it should work with any version of GDB that supports that feature.<p>
Throughout this section, we demonstrate the debugging extensions in Pin with the example tool "stack-debugger.cpp", which is available in the directory "source/tools/ManualExamples". You may want to compile that tool and follow along:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ cd source/tools/ManualExamples
$ make DEBUG=1 stack-debugger.test
</pre></div><p>
The tool and its associated test application, "fibonacci", are built in a directory named "obj-ia32", "obj-intel64", etc., depending on your machine type.<p>
To enable the debugging extensions, run Pin with the <a class="el" href="group__KNOBS.html#SWITCH_APPDEBUG">-appdebug</a> command line switch. This causes Pin to start the application and stop immediately before the first instruction. Pin then prints a message telling you to start GDB.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ pin -appdebug -t stack-debugger.so -- fibonacci 1000
Application stopped until continued from debugger.
Start GDB, then issue this command at the (gdb) prompt:
  target remote :33030
</pre></div><p>
In another window, start GDB and enter the command that Pin printed:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ gdb fibonacci
(gdb) target remote :33030
</pre></div><p>
At this point, the debugger is attached to the application that is running under Pin. You can set breakpoints, continue execution, print out variables, disassemble code, etc.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401194: file fibonacci.cpp, line 12.
(gdb) cont
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0x7fbffff3c8) at fibonacci.cpp:12

(gdb) print argc
$1 = 2
(gdb) x/4i $pc

0x40119b &lt;main+34&gt;:     je     0x4011c8 &lt;main+79&gt;

0x4011a2 &lt;main+41&gt;:     mov    $0x603300,%edi
</pre></div><p>
Of course, any information you observe in the debugger shows the application's "pure" state. The details of Pin and the tool's instrumentation are hidden. For example, the disassembly you see above shows only the application's instructions, not any of the instructions inserted by the tool. However, when you use commands like "cont" or "step" to advance execution of the application, your tool's instrumentation runs as it normally would under Pin.<p>
<dl class="note" compact><dt><b>Note:</b></dt><dd>After connecting GDB with the "target remote" command, you should NOT use the "run" command. The application is already running and stopped at the first instruction. Instead, use the "cont" command to continue execution.</dd></dl>
<h4><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG_LINUX_COMMANDS">
Adding New Debugger Commands</a></h4>
The previous section illustrated how you can enable the normal debugger features while running an application under Pin. Now, let's see how your Pintool can add new custom debugger commands, even without changing GDB. Custom debugger commands are useful because they allow you to control your Pintool interactively from within a live debugger session. For example, you can ask your Pintool to print out information that it has collected, or you can interactively enable instrumentation only for certain phases of the application.<p>
To illustrate, see the call to <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gf04a042d4858af02c4b5f24b343d9f09">PIN_AddDebugInterpreter()</a> in the stack-debugger tool. That API sets up the following call-back function:<p>

</pre></div><p>
The <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gf04a042d4858af02c4b5f24b343d9f09">PIN_AddDebugInterpreter()</a> API allows a Pintool to establish a handler for extended GDB commands. For example, the code snippet above implements the new commands "stats" and "stacktrace on". You can execute these commands in GDB by using the "monitor" command:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
(gdb) monitor stats
Current stack usage: 688 bytes.
Maximum stack usage: 0 bytes.
</pre></div><p>
A Pintool can do various things when the user types an extended debugger command. For example, the "stats" command prints out some information that the tool has collected. Any text that the tool writes to the "result" parameter is printed to the GDB console. Note that the CONTEXT parameter has the register state for the debugger's "focus" thread, so the tool can easily display information about this focus thread.<p>
You can also use an extended debugger command to interactively enable or disable instrumentation in your Pintool, as demonstrated by the "stacktrace on" command. For example, if you wanted to quickly run your Pintool over the application's initial start-up phase, you could run with your Pintool's instrumentation disabled until a breakpoint is triggered. Then, you could use an extended command to enable instrumentation only during the interesting part of the application. In the stack-debugger example above, the call to <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#g7f5784c3b9431086f3b5b750912ca0c2">PIN_RemoveInstrumentation()</a> causes Pin to discard any previous instrumentation, so the tool re-instruments the code when the debugger continues execution of the application. As we will see later, the tool's global variable "EnableInstrumentation" adjusts the instrumentation that it inserts.<h4><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG_LINUX_BREAK">
Semantic Breakpoints</a></h4>
The last major feature of the advanced debugging extensions is the ability to stop execution at a breakpoint by calling an API from your tool's analysis code. This may sound simple, but it is very powerful. Your Pintool can use instrumentation to look for a complex condition and then stop at a breakpoint when that condition occurs.<p>
The "stack-debugger" tool illustrates this by using instrumentation to observe all the instructions that allocate stack space, and then it stops at a breakpoint whenever the application's stack usage reaches some threshold. In effect, this adds a new feature to the debugger that could not be practically implemented using traditional debugger technology because a traditional debugger can not reasonably find all the instructions that allocate stack space. A Pintool, however, can do this quite easily via instrumentation.<p>
The example code below from the "stack-debugger" tool uses Pin instrumentation to identify all the instructions that allocate stack space.<p>

If it does, we insert an analysis call immediately after the instruction, which checks to see if the application's stack usage exceeds a threshold.<p>
Also notice that all the instrumentation is gated by the global flag "EnableInstrumentation", which we saw earlier in the "stacktrace on" command. Thus, the user can disable instrumentation (with "stacktrace off") in order to execute quickly through uninteresting parts of the application, and then re-enable it (with "stacktrace on") for the interesting parts.<p>
The analysis routine OnStackChangeIf() returns TRUE if the application's stack usage has exceeded the threshold. When this happens, the tool calls the DoBreakpoint() analysis routine, which will stop at the debugger breakpoint. Notice that we use if / then instrumentation here because the call to DoBreakpoint() requires a "CONTEXT *" parameter, which can be slow.<p>

The analysis routine OnStackChangeIf() keeps track of some metrics on stack usage and tests whether the threshold has been reached. If the threshold is crossed, it returns non-zero, and Pin executes the DoBreakpoint() analysis routine.<p>
The interesting part of DoBreakpoint() is at the very end, where it calls <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gd46f50d48ebcf2414e766c2978111c4b">PIN_ApplicationBreakpoint()</a>. This API causes Pin to stop the execution of all threads and triggers a breakpoint in the debugger. There is also a string parameter to <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gd46f50d48ebcf2414e766c2978111c4b">PIN_ApplicationBreakpoint()</a>, which GDB prints at the console when the breakpoint triggers. A Pintool can use this string to tell the user why a breakpoint triggered. In our example tool, this string says something like "Thread 10 uses 4000 bytes of stack".<p>
We can see the breakpoint feature in action in our example tool by using the "stackbreak 4000" command like this:<p>

Connecting the Debugger Later</a></h4>
In the previous example, we used the Pin switch <a class="el" href="group__KNOBS.html#SWITCH_APPDEBUG">-appdebug</a> to stop the application and debug it from the first instruction. You can also enable Pin's debugging extensions without stopping at the first instruction. The following example shows how you can use the stack-debugger tool to start the application and attach with the debugger only after it triggers a stack limit breakpoint.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ pin -appdebug_enable -appdebug_silent -t stack-debugger.so -stackbreak 4000 -- fibonacci 1000
</pre></div><p>
The <a class="el" href="group__KNOBS.html#SWITCH_APPDEBUG_ENABLE">-appdebug_enable</a> switch tells Pin to enable application debugging without stopping at the first instruction. The <a class="el" href="group__KNOBS.html#SWITCH_APPDEBUG_SILENT">-appdebug_silent</a> switch disables the message that tells how to connect with GDB. As we will see later, the Pintool can print a custom message instead. Finally, the "-stackbreak 4000" switch tells the stack-debugger tool to trigger a breakpoint when the stack grows to 4000 bytes. When the tool does trigger a breakpoint, it prints a message like this:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
Triggered stack-limit breakpoint.
Start GDB and enter this command:
  target remote :45462
</pre></div><p>
You can now connect with GDB as you did before, except now GDB stops the application at the point where the stack-debugger tool triggered the stack-limit breakpoint.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

The ConnectDebugger() function is called each time the tool wants to stop at a breakpoint. It first calls <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gb15de5ddf44f7deef79a42e7b041ac12">PIN_GetDebugStatus()</a> to see if Pin is already connected to a debugger.

This is, for example, the "45462" number that the user types in the "target remote" command. After asking the user to start GDB, the tool then calls <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gb76db0d06ebabd4a42540a92016b9d13">PIN_WaitForDebuggerToConnect()</a> to wait for GDB to connect. If the user doesn't start GDB after a timeout period, the tool prints a message and then continues executing the application.<p>

Advanced Debugging Extensions on Windows</a></h3>
On Windows, the advanced debugging extensions work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. There is no support for earlier versions of Visual Studio, so make sure you have that version installed. Also, the Express edition of Visual Studio doesn't support IDE extensions, so it will not work with the Pin debugger extensions. Therefore, you must install the Professional edition (or greater). If you are a student, you may be able to get the Professional edition for free. Check the Microsoft web site or with your school's IT department for details.<p>
After you have installed Visual Studio, you must also install the Pin extension for Visual Studio. Look for an installer named "pinadx-vsextension-X.Y.Z.msi" in the root of the Pin kit.<p>
If you are developing a Pintool, you must also use Visual Studio to build the tool. However, there is not yet support for building Pintools with Visual Studio 2012. As a result, you must also install either Visual Studio 2010 or 2008 in order to build your tool. You can use any edition to build a Pintool, even the free Express edition.<p>
The remainder of this section assumes that you are able to build the "stack-debugger" tool, so if you want to follow along, you must have the following software installed:<p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2012, Professional edition (or greater).</li><li>The Pin debugger extension for Visual Studio 2012 (pinadx-vsextension-X.Y.Z.msi).</li><li>Either Visual Studio 2010 or 2008, any edition.</li></ul>
<p>
In order to start this tutorial, you will probably want to build the example tool "stack-debugger.cpp", which is available in the directory "source\tools\ManualExamples". To do this, open a Visual Studio command shell and type the following commands. (Use "TARGET=intel64" instead, if you want to build a 64-bit version of the tool.)<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
C:\&gt; cd source\tools\ManualExamples
C:\&gt; make TARGET=ia32 obj-ia32/stack-debugger.dll
</pre></div><p>
After you have done this, start Visual Studio 2012 and open the sample solution file at "source\tools\ManualExamples\stack-debugger-tutorial.sln". Then build the sample application "fibonacci" by pressing F7. Make sure you can run the application natively by pressing CTRL-F5.<p>
Now let's try running the "fibonacci" application under Pin with the "stack-debugger" tool. To do this, you must first set the "Pin Kit Directory" from TOOLS-&gt;Options-&gt;Pin Debugger.<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="pin-debugger-option-pages-properties.png" alt="pin-debugger-option-pages-properties.png">
</div>
<p>
Then you have to adjust the "fibonacci" project properties in Visual Studio 2012: right-click on the "fibonacci" project in the Solution Explorer, choose Properties, and then click on Debugging. Change the drop-down titled "Debugger to launch" to "Pin Debugger" as shown in the figure below.<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="pin-debugger-project-properties1.png" alt="pin-debugger-project-properties1.png">
</div>
<p>
Then, set the "Pin Tool Path" property by browsing to the "stack-debugger.dll". Press OK when you are done.<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="pin-debugger-project-properties2.png" alt="pin-debugger-project-properties2.png">
</div>
<p>
Visual Studio is now configured to run the "fibonacci" application under your Pin tool. However, before you continue, set a breakpoint in "main()" so that execution stops in the debugger. Then press F5 to start debugging.<p>
You should now see a normal-looking debugger session, although your application is really running under control of Pin. All of the debugger features still work as you would expect. You can set breakpoints, continue execution, display the values of variables, and even view the disassembled code. All of the information that you observe in the debugger shows the application's "pure" state. The details of Pin and the tool's instrumentation are hidden. For example, the disassembly view shows only the application's instructions, not any of the instructions inserted by the tool. However, when you continue execution (e.g. with F5 or F10), the application executes along with your tool's instrumentation code.<p>
Now, let's see an alternative way to debug the "fibonacci" application under Pin with the "stack-debugger" tool in Visual Studio 2012. After you have built the "stack-debugger" tool, open a command shell and start the application with the debugging extensions enabled. This will cause Pin to stop immediately before the first instruction.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
C:\&gt; cd source\tools\ManualExamples
C:\&gt; ..\..\..\pin -appdebug -t obj-ia32\stack-debugger.dll -- debug\fibonacci.exe 1000

Pin ready to accept debugger connection on port 30840
</pre></div><p>
Open the source\tools\ManualExamples\fibonacci.cpp in Visual Studio 2012 and set a breakpoint to stop the execution in the debugger. To attach with Visual Studio to the process that is running under Pin, select "Attach to Pin Process" on the DEBUG menu. Select from the Available Processes table the "fibonacci" process, enter the port number that Pin printed and click Attach.<p>

<h4><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG_WINDOWS_COMMANDS">
Adding New Debugger Commands</a></h4>
The previous section illustrated how you can enable the normal debugger features while running an application under Pin. Now, let's see how your Pintool can add new custom debugger commands, even without changing Visual Studio. Custom debugger commands are useful because they allow you to control your Pintool interactively from within a live debugger session. For example, you can ask your Pintool to print out information that it has collected, or you can interactively enable instrumentation only for certain phases of the application.<p>
To illustrate, see the call to <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gf04a042d4858af02c4b5f24b343d9f09">PIN_AddDebugInterpreter()</a> in the stack-debugger tool. That API sets up the following call-back function:<p>

The <a class="el" href="group__APPDEBUG__API.html#gf04a042d4858af02c4b5f24b343d9f09">PIN_AddDebugInterpreter()</a> API allows a Pintool to establish a handler for extended debugger commands. For example, the code snippet above implements the new commands "stats" and "stacktrace on". You can execute these commands in Visual Studio by opening "DEBUG-&gt;Windows-&gt;Pin Console" in the IDE.<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="stack-debugger-commands.png" alt="stack-debugger-commands.png">
</div>
<p>
A Pintool can do various things when the user types an extended debugger command. For example, the "stats" command prints out some information that the tool has collected. Any text that the tool writes to the "result" parameter is printed to the Visual Studio Pin Console window. Note that the CONTEXT parameter has the register state for the debugger's "focus" thread, so the tool can easily display information about this focus thread.<p>
You can also use an extended debugger command to interactively enable or disable instrumentation in your Pintool, as demonstrated by the "stacktrace on" command. For example, if you wanted to quickly run your Pintool over the application's initial start-up phase, you could run with your Pintool's instrumentation disabled until a breakpoint is triggered. Then, you could use an extended command to enable instrumentation only during the interesting part of the application. In the stack-debugger example above, the call to <a class="el" href="group__PIN__CONTROL.html#g7f5784c3b9431086f3b5b750912ca0c2">PIN_RemoveInstrumentation()</a> causes Pin to discard any previous instrumentation, so the tool re-instruments the code when the debugger continues execution of the application. As we will see later, the tool's global variable "EnableInstrumentation" adjusts the instrumentation that it inserts.<h4><a class="anchor" name="APPDEBUG_WINDOWS_BREAK">
Semantic Breakpoints</a></h4>
The last major feature of the advanced debugging extensions is the ability to stop execution at a breakpoint by calling an API from your tool's analysis code. This may sound simple, but it is very powerful. Your Pintool can use instrumentation to look for a complex condition and then stop at a breakpoint when that condition occurs.<p>
The "stack-debugger" tool illustrates this by using instrumentation to observe all the instructions that allocate stack space, and then it stops at a breakpoint whenever the application's stack usage reaches some threshold. In effect, this adds a new feature to the debugger that could not be practically implemented using traditional debugger technology because a traditional debugger can not reasonably find all the instructions that allocate stack space. A Pintool, however, can do this quite easily via instrumentation.<p>
The example code below from the "stack-debugger" tool uses Pin instrumentation to identify all the instructions that allocate stack space.<p>

If it does, we insert an analysis call immediately after the instruction, which checks to see if the application's stack usage exceeds a threshold.<p>
Also notice that all the instrumentation is gated by the global flag "EnableInstrumentation", which we saw earlier in the "stacktrace on" command. Thus, the user can disable instrumentation (with "stacktrace off") in order to execute quickly through uninteresting parts of the application, and then re-enable it (with "stacktrace on") for the interesting parts.<p>
The analysis routine OnStackChangeIf() returns TRUE if the application's stack usage has exceeded the threshold. When this happens, the tool calls the DoBreakpoint() analysis routine, which will stop at the debugger breakpoint. Notice that we use if / then instrumentation here because the call to DoBreakpoint() requires a "CONTEXT *" parameter, which can be slow.<p>

A Pintool can use this string to tell the user why a breakpoint triggered. In our example tool, this string says something like "Thread 10 uses 4000 bytes of stack".<p>
We can see the breakpoint feature in action in our example tool by typing this command in the Pin Console window:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
&gt;stackbreak 4000
Will break when thread uses more than 4000 bytes of stack.
</pre></div><p>
Then press F5 to continue execution. The application should stop in the debugger again with a message like this:<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="stack-debugger-custom-break.png" alt="stack-debugger-custom-break.png">
</div>
<p>
When you are done, you can either continue the application with F5 or terminate it with SHIFT-F5.<p>

Applying a Pintool to an Application</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
An application and a tool are invoked as follows:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
pin [pin-option]... -t [toolname] [tool-options]... -- [application] [application-option]..
</pre></div><p>
These are a few of the Pin options are currently available. See <a class="el" href="group__KNOBS.html">Command Line Switches</a> for the complete list. <ul>
<li>
-t <em>toolname</em>: Specifies the Pintool to use. If you are running a 32-bit application in an IA-32 architecture, or a 64-bit application on an Intel(R) 64 architecture, only -t &lt;toolname&gt; is needed. If you are running an application on an Intel(R) 64 architecture, where all of the components in the chain are either 32-bit or 64-bit, but not both, only -t &lt;toolname&gt; is needed. If you are running an application on an Intel(R) 64 architecture, where components in the chain are both 32-bit and 64-bit, use -t64 &lt;64-bit toolname&gt; to specify the 64-bit tool binary followed by -t &lt;32-bit toolname&gt; to specify the 32-bit tool binary and the tool options. For more information, see <a class="el" href="index.html#MIXED-MODE">Instrumenting Applications on Intel(R) 64 Architectures</a> </li>
<li>
-t64 <em>toolname</em>: Specify 64-bit tool binary for Intel(R) 64 architecture. If you are running an application on an Intel(R) 64 architecture, where components in the chain are both 32-bit and 64-bit, use -t64 together with -t as described above. See <a class="el" href="index.html#MIXED-MODE">Instrumenting Applications on Intel(R) 64 Architectures</a>. <br>
 <b>Important</b>: Using -t64 without -t is not recommended, since in this case when given a 32-bit application, Pin will run the application without applying any tool. </li>
<li>
-p32 <em>toolname</em>: Specify Pin binary for IA-32 architecture. See <a class="el" href="index.html#MIXED-MODE">Instrumenting Applications on Intel(R) 64 Architectures</a> </li>
<li>
-p64 <em>toolname</em>: Specify Pin binary for Intel(R) 64 architecture. See <a class="el" href="index.html#MIXED-MODE">Instrumenting Applications on Intel(R) 64 Architectures</a> </li>
<li>
-pause_tool n: is a useful Pin-option which prints out the process id and pauses Pin for n seconds to permit attaching with gdb. See <a class="el" href="index.html#DEBUGGING">Tips for Debugging a Pintool</a>. </li>
<li>
-follow_execv: Execute with Pin all processes spawned by execv class system calls. </li>
<li>
-injection <em>mode</em>: Where <em>mode</em> is one of dynamic, self, child, parent. <em>UNIX-only</em> See <a class="el" href="index.html#INJECTION">Injection</a>.<p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tool-options follow immediately after the tool specification and depend on the tool used.<p>
Everything following the <code>--</code> is the command line for the application.<p>
For example, to apply the itrace example (<a class="el" href="index.html#IAddressTrace">Instruction Address Trace (Instruction Instrumentation)</a>) to a run of the "ls" program:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
pin -t itrace.so -- /bin/ls

To get a listing of the available command line options for the itrace example:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

Note that in the last case <code>/bin/ls</code> is necessary on the command line but will not be executed.<h3><a class="anchor" name="MIXED-MODE">
Instrumenting Applications on Intel(R) 64 Architectures</a></h3>
The Pin kit for IA-32 and Intel(R) 64 architectures is a combined kit. Both a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version of Pin are present in the kit. This allows Pin to instrument complex applications on Intel(R) 64 architectures which may have 32-bit and 64-bit components.<p>
An application and a tool are invoked in "mixed-mode" as follows:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
pin [pin-option]... -t64 &lt;64-bit toolname&gt; -t &lt;32-bit toolname&gt; [tool-options]...
-- &lt;application&gt; [application-option]..
</pre></div><p>
Please note:<ul>
<li>The -t64 option must precede the -t option.</li><li>When using -t64 together with -t, -t specifies the 32-bit tool. Using -t64 without -t is not recommended, since in this case when given a 32-bit application, Pin will run the application without applying any tool.</li><li>The <em>[tool-options]</em> apply to both the 64-bit and the 32-bit tools and <b>must</b> be specified <b>after</b> <em>-t &lt;32-bit toolname&gt;</em>. It is not possible to specify different set of options for the 64-bit and the 32-bit tools.</li></ul>
<p>
See source/tools/CrossIa32Intel64/makefile for a few examples.<p>
The file "pin" is a c-based launcher executable that expects the Pin binary "pinbin" to be in the architecture-specific "bin" subdirectory (i.e. intel64/bin). The "pin" launcher distinguishes the 32-bit version of the Pin binary from the 64-bit version of the Pin binary by using the -p32/-p64 switches, respectively. Today, the 32-bit version of the Pin binary is invoked, and the path of the 64-bit version of Pin is passed as an argument using the -p64 switch. However, one could change this to invoke the 64-bit version of the Pin binary, and pass the 32-bit version of the Pin binary as an argument using the -p32 switch.<h3><a class="anchor" name="INJECTION">
Injection</a></h3>
The -injection switch is UNIX-only and controls the way pin is injected into the application process. The default, dynamic, is recommended for all users. It uses parent injection unless it is unsupported (Linux 2.4 kernels). Child injection creates the application process as a child of the pin process so you will see both a pin process and the application process running. In parent injection, the pin process exits after injecting the application and is less likely to cause a problem. Using parent injection on an unsupported platform may lead to nondeterministic errors.<p>
IMPORTANT: The description about invoking assumes that the application is a program binary (and not a shell script). If your application is invoked indirectly (from a shell script or using 'exec') then you need to change the actual invocation of the program binary by prefixing it with pin/pintool options. Here's one way of doing that:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 # Track down the actual application binary, say it is 'application_binary'.
 % mv application_binary application_binary.real

 # Write a shell script named 'application_binary' with the following contents.
 # (change 'itrace' to your desired tool)

 #!/bin/sh
 pin -t itrace.so -- application_binary.real $*
</pre></div><p>
After you do this, whenever 'application_binary' is invoked indirectly (from some shell script or using 'exec'), the real binary will get invoked with the right pin/pintool options.<h3><a class="anchor" name="RESTRICTIONS">
Restrictions</a></h3>
There is a known problem of using pin on systems protected by the "McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention"* antivirus software. We did not test coexistence of pin with other antivirus products that perform run-time execution monitoring.<p>
There is a known problem of using Pin on Linux systems that prevent the use of ptrace attach via the sysctl /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope. In this case Pin is not able to use its default (parent) injection mode. To resolve this, either execute the following (as root): <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
</pre></div> Or use the "-injection child" option. For more information regarding child injection, See <a class="el" href="index.html#INJECTION">Injection</a>.<p>

Using gdb on Linux</a></h3>
When running an application under the control of Pin and a Pintool there are two different programs residing in the address space. The application, and the Pin instrumentation engine together with your Pintool. The pintool is normally a shared object loaded by Pin. This section describes how to use gdb to find bugs in a Pintool. You cannot run Pin directly from gdb since Pin uses the debugging API to start the application. Instead, you must invoke Pin from the command line with the -pause_tool switch, and use gdb to attach to the Pin process from another window. The -pause_tool n switch makes Pin print out the process identifier (pid) and pause for n seconds.<p>
Pin searches for the tool in an internal search algorithm. Therefore in many cases gdb is unable to load the debug info for the tool. There are several options to help gdb find the debug info.<p>
Option 1 is to use full path to the tool when running pin.<p>
Option 2 is to tell gdb to load the debugging information of the tool. Pin prompts with the exact gdb command to be used in this case.<p>
To check that gdb loaded the debugging info to the tool use the command "info sharedlibrary" and you should see that gdb has read the symbols for your tool (as in the example below).<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

Using the Visual Studio Debugger on Windows</a></h3>
When running an application under the control of Pin and a Pintool there are two different programs residing in the address space. The application, and the Pin instrumentation engine together with your Pintool. The pintool is a dynamically loaded library (.dll) loaded by Pin. This section describes how to use the Visual Studio Debugger to find bugs in a Pintool. You cannot run Pin directly from the debugger since Pin uses the debugging API to start the application. Instead, you must invoke Pin from the command line with the -pause_tool switch, and use Visual Studio to attach to the Pin process from another window. The -pause_tool n switch makes Pin print out the process identifier (pid) and pause for n seconds. You have n seconds (20 in our example) to attach the application with the debugger.<p>

Performance Considerations When Writing  a Pintool</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
The way a Pintool is written can have great impact on the performace of the tool, i.e. how much it slows down the applications it is instrumenting. This section demonstrates some techniques that can be used to improve tool performance. Let's start with an example. The following piece of code is derived from the source/tools/SimpleExamples/edgcnt.cpp:<p>
The instrumentation component of the tool is show below<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">VOID Instruction(INS ins, <span class="keywordtype">void</span> *v)

                       IARG_END);
      }

      ...
}
</pre></div><p>
The analysis component looks like this: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">VOID docount2( ADDRINT src, ADDRINT dst, INT32 taken )
{
    <span class="keywordflow">if</span>(!taken) <span class="keywordflow">return</span>;
    COUNTER *pedg = Lookup( src,dst );
    pedg-&gt;_count++;
}
</pre></div><p>
The purpose of the tool is to count how often each controlflow changing edge in the control flowgraph is traversed. The tool considers both calls and branches but for brevity we will not mention branches in our description. The tool works as follows: The instrumentation component instruments each branch with a call to docount2. As parameters we pass in the origin and the target of the branch and whether the branch was taken or not. Branch origin and target represent of the source and destination of the controlflow edges. If a branch is not taken the controlflow does not change and hence the analysis routine returns right away. If the branch is taken we use the src and dst parameters to look up the counter associated with this edge (Lookup will create a new one if this edge has not been seen before) and increment the counter. Note, that the tool could have been simplified somewhat by using IPOINT_TAKEN_BRANCH option with <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#g74a956a0acde197043d04f4adcde4626">INS_InsertCall()</a>.<h3><a class="anchor" name="shifting_computation">
Shifting Computation for Analysis to Instrumentation Code</a></h3>
About every 5th instruction executed in a typical application is a branch. Lookup will called whenever these instruction are executed, causing significant application slowdown. To improve the situation we note that the instrumentation code is typically called only once for every instruction, while the analysis code is called everytime the instruction is executed. If we can somehow shift computation from the analysis code to the instrumentation code we will improve the overall performance. Our example tools offer multiple such opportunites which will explore in turn. The first observation is that for most branches we can find out inside of Instruction() what the branch target will be . For those branches we can call Lookup inside of Instruction() rather than in docount2(), for indirect branches which are relatively rare we still have to use our original approach. All this is reflected in the folling code. We add a second "lighter" analsysis function, docount. While the original docount2() remains unchanged:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">VOID docount( COUNTER *pedg, INT32 taken )
{
    <span class="keywordflow">if</span>( !taken ) <span class="keywordflow">return</span>;
    pedg-&gt;_count++;
}
</pre></div><p>
And the instrumentation will be somewhat more complex:<p>

The code for docount() is very compact which provides performance advantages; it may also allow it to be inlined by Pin, thereby avoiding the overhead of a call. The heuristics for when a analysis routine is inlined by Pin are subject to change. But small routines without any control flow (single basic block) are almost guaranteed to be inlined. Unfortunately, docount() does have (albeit limited) control flow. Observing that the parameter, 'taken', will be zero or one we can eliminate the remaining control flow as follows:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">VOID docount( COUNTER *pedg, INT32 taken )
{
    pedg-&gt;_count += taken;
}
</pre></div><p>
Now docount() can be inlined.<h3><a class="anchor" name="compiler_inlining">
Compiler Considerations for Inlining</a></h3>
The way that the tool is built affects inlining as well. If an analysis routine has a function call to another function, it would not be a candidate for inlining by Pin unless the function call was inlined by the compiler. If the function call is inlined by the compiler, the analysis routine would be a candidate for inlining by Pin. Therefore, it is advisable to write any subroutines called by the analysis routine in a way that allows the compiler to inline the subroutines.<p>
On Linux IA-32 architectures, Pin tools are built non-PIC (Position Independent Code), which allows the compiler to inline both local and global functions. Tools for Linux Intel 64 architectures are built PIC, but the compiler will not inline any globally visible function due to function pre-emption. Therefore, it is advisable to declare the subroutines called by the analysis function as 'static' on Linux Intel 64 architectures.<h3><a class="anchor" name="let_pin_decide">
Letting Pin Decide Where to Instrument</a></h3>
At times we do not care about the exact point where calls to analysis code are being inserted as long as it is within a given basic block. In this case we can let Pin make the decission where to insert. This has the advantage that Pin can select am insertion point that requires minimal register saving and restoring. The following code from ManualExamples/inscount2.cpp shows how this is done for the instruction count example using IPOINT_ANYWHERE with <a class="el" href="group__BBL__BASIC__API.html#geee9d7a6253d49d226bbed3f35768169">BBL_InsertCall()</a>.<p>

Using Fast Call Linkages</a></h3>
For very small analysis functions, the overhead to call the function can be comparable to the work done in the function. Some compilers offer optimized call linkages that eliminate some of the overhead. For example, gcc for the IA-32 architecture has a regparm attribute for passing arguments in registers. Pin supports a limited number of alternate linkages. To use it, you must annotate the declaration of the analysis function with <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#g5d3025eb005b7ea4745799f0ee1b86a6">PIN_FAST_ANALYSIS_CALL</a>. The InsertCall function must pass <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#gg089c27ca15e9ff139dd3a3f8a6f8451d892dbdf11883df94c327bb31fd0d5fcd">IARG_FAST_ANALYSIS_CALL</a>. If you change one without changing the other, the arguments will not be passed correctly. See the inscount2.cpp example in the previous section for a sample use. For large analysis functions, the benefit may not be significant, but it is unlikely that PIN_FAST_ANALYSIS_CALL would ever cause a slowdown.<p>
Another call linkage optimization is to eliminate the frame pointer. We recommend using -fomit-frame-pointer to compile tools with gcc. See the gcc documentation for an explanation of what it does. The standard Pintool makefiles include -fomit-frame-pointer. Like PIN_FAST_ANALYSIS_CALL, the benefit is largest for small analysis functions. Debuggers rely on frame pointers to display stack traces, so eliminate this option when trying to debug a PinTool. If you are using a standard PinTool makefile, you can do this by overriding the definition of OPT on the command line with<p>

Rewriting Conditional Analysis Code to Help Pin Inline</a></h3>
Pin improves instrumentation performance by automatically inlining analysis routines that have no control-flow changes. Of course, many analysis routines do have control-flow changes. One particularly common case is that an analysis routine has a single "if-then" test, where a small amount of analysis code plus the test is always executed but the "then" part is executed only once a while. To inline this common case, Pin provides a set of conditional instrumentation APIs for the tool writer to rewrite their analysis routines into a form that does not have control-flow changes. The following example from source/tools/ManualExamples/isampling.cpp illustrates how such rewriting can be done:<p>

In the above example, the original analysis routine IpSample() has a conditional control-flow change. It is rewritten into two analysis routines: CountDown() and PrintIp(). CountDown() is the simpler one of the two, which doesn't have control-flow change. It also performs the original conditional test and returns the test result. We use the conditional instrumentaton APIs <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#g7907ad8ebd991b9e24df3b3b9cec4cac">INS_InsertIfCall()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#g952b2b061d3fa8f1cc4d5d59fef53a69">INS_InsertThenCall()</a> to tell Pin that tbe analysis routine specified by an <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#g952b2b061d3fa8f1cc4d5d59fef53a69">INS_InsertThenCall()</a> (i.e. PrintIp() in this example) is executed only if the result of the analysis routine specified by the previous <a class="el" href="group__INS__INST__API.html#g7907ad8ebd991b9e24df3b3b9cec4cac">INS_InsertIfCall()</a> (i.e. CountDown() in this example) is non-zero.

Optimizing Instrumentation of REP Prefixed Instructions</a></h3>
The IA-32 and Intel 64 architectures include REP prefixed string instructions. These use a REP prefix on a string operation to repeat the execution of the inner operation. For some instructions the repeat count is determined solely by the value in the count register. For others (SCAS,CMPS), the count register provides an upper limit on the number of iterations, while the REP opcode provides a condition to be tested which can exit the REP loop before the full number of iterations has been executed.<p>
Pin treats REP prefixed instructions as an implicit loop around the inner instruction, so <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#gg707ea08e31f44f4a81e2a7766123bad77c7cbebb7a62a40e9f803b1db2e6ce20">IPOINT_BEFORE</a> and <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#gg707ea08e31f44f4a81e2a7766123bad742eff26179c6d87348abe492301c12ec">IPOINT_AFTER</a> instrumentation is executed for that instruction once for each iteration of the (implicit) loop. Since each execution of the inner instruction is instrumented, IARG_MEMORY{READ,READ2,WRITE}_SIZE can be determined statically from the instruction (1,2,4,8 bytes), and IARG_MEMORY{OP,READ,READ2,WRITE}_EA can also be determined (even if DF==1, so the inner instructions are decrementing their arguments and moving backwards through store).<p>

Since there are real codes where a significant proportion of all instructions are REP prefixed, using <a class="el" href="group__INST__ARGS.html#gg089c27ca15e9ff139dd3a3f8a6f8451d4e8c634973d6966dba21ff70455c1f5b">IARG_FIRST_REP_ITERATION</a> to collect information at the beginning of the REP "loop" while skipping it for the later iterations can be a significant optimization.<p>
A tool which demonstrates all of these techniques can be found in source/tools/ManualExamples/countreps.cpp, from which these (slightly edited) code snippets were taken.<p>
======================================================================================== <h2><a class="anchor" name="RESTRICTIONS">
Restrictions</a></h2>
========================================================================================<h3><a class="anchor" name="General">
General</a></h3>
There are several things that a Pintool writer must be aware of.<ul>
<li>pthread functions cannot be called from an analysis or replacement routine (<a class="el" href="index.html#MT">Instrumenting Multi-threaded Applications</a>)</li><li>IARG_REG_VALUE cannot be used to pass floating point register values to an analysis routine.</li><li>Also, see the OS-specific restrictions below. <a class="el" href="index.html#WINDOWS_OS">Windows OS</a> or <a class="el" href="index.html#LINUX_OS">Linux OS</a></li></ul>
<p>
Often, a Pintool writer wants to run the SPEC benchmarks to see the results of their research. There are many ways one can update the scripts to invoke Pin on the SPEC tests; this is one. In your $SPEC/config file, add the following two lines:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">   submit=$PIN_HOME/intel64/bin/pin -t /my/pin/tool -- $command
   use_submit_for_speed=yes
</pre></div><p>
Now the SPEC harness will automatically run Pin with whatever benchmarks it runs. Note that you need the full path name for Pin and Pintool binaries. Replace "intel64" with "ia32" if you are using a 32-bit system.<h3><a class="anchor" name="LINUX_OS">
Linux OS</a></h3>
Pin identifies system calls at the actual system call trap instruction, not the libc function call wrapper. Tools need to be aware of oddities like this when interpreting system call arguments, etc.<h3><a class="anchor" name="WINDOWS_OS">
Windows OS</a></h3>
On Windows, Pin has been compiled with /D_SECURE_SCL=0. Pintools must also be compiled with /D_SECURE_SCL=0, otherwise the STL containers shared between Pin and the Pintool can have different memory layouts.<p>
Pin on Windows guarantees safe usage of C/C++ run-time services in Pin tools, including indirect calls to Windows API through C run-time library. Any other use of Windows API in Pin tool is not guaranteed to be safe:<ul>
<li>reentrant use of shared system resources may cause crashes and lost of transparency</li><li>a tool that directly or indirectly locks shared resource by calling to a system API under Pin lock may cause deadlock</li><li>using alertable system calls or installing handlers of asynchronous system events in a tool may violate the logic of the application, cause recursive invocation of instrumentation/analysis callbacks in the tool.</li></ul>
<p>
Pin on Windows does not separate DLLs loaded by the tool from the application DLLs - it uses the same system loader. In order to avoid isolation problems, Pin tool should not load any DLL that can be shared with the application. For the same reason, Pin tool should avoid static links to any common DLL, except for those listed in PIN_COMMON_LIBS (see source\tools\ms.flags file).<p>
In probe mode, the application runs natively, and the probe is placed in the original code. If a tool replaces a function shared by the tool and the application, an undesirable behavior may occur. For example, if a tool replaces EnterCriticalSection() with an analysis routine that calls printf(), this could result in an infinite loop, because printf() can also call EnterCriticalSection(). The application would call EnterCriticalSection(), and the control flow would go to the replacement routine, and it would call EnterCriticalSection() (via printf) which would call the replacement routine, and so on.<h3><a class="anchor" name="namespace">
Conflicts between Pin and Windows</a></h3>
Pin uses some base types that conflict with Windows types. If you use "windows.h", you may see compilation errors. To avoid this problem, we recommend wrapping the windows.h file as follows. Items that reside in the windows.h file must be referenced using the WINDOWS:: prefix.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment"><span class="keyword">namespace </span>WINDOWS
{
<span class="preprocessor">#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</span>
}
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="building">
Building tools for kit in different versions of Visual Studio</a></h3>
In order to use pin kit VC8, you must have Visual studio 2005 installed on your computer. In order to use pin kit VC9, you must have Visual studio 2008 installed on your computer. In order to use pin kit VC10, you must have Visual studio 2010 installed on your computer.<p>
According to the Visual Studio version an example of visual studio project that builds pin tool in the Visual Studio IDE will be placed in the  directory. Enter this directory and open MyPinTool.vcproj project or MyPinTool.sln solution. To build the tool, select "Build Solution".<p>
To run an application, instrumented by MyPinTool, select Tool-&gt;External Tools. In the "Menu contents" window choose "run pin". Add to the "Arguments" box the path of the required application that you want to run with pin. For example: -t MyPinTool.dll -count 1 -- "C:\Users\..\my_app.exe" and select "OK". A Popup window may appear on the screen with the following message: "The command is not a valid executable. Would you like to change the command?" select "No". To start running your application select Tool-&gt;pin run.<p>
You can select another application and change tool's switches in the "MyPinTool Properties-&gt;Debugging" page.<p>
You can use MyPinTool as a template for your own project. Please, look carefully at the compilation and linking switches in the MyPinTool property pages. Mandatory switches can be found in the ms.flags file in the kit's source/tools directory. Also note the library order, as this is important, too.<p>
The mandatory compiler switches are:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  /MT              link to static CRT library. Using
                   CRT DLL could cause conflict with

Constructing PinTools from multiple DLLs on Windows</a></h3>
A Pin tool can be composed from multiple DLLs:<ul>
<li>"main DLL", which is specified in the Pin command line after "-t" switch</li><li>a number of "secondary DLLs", linked to the "main DLL" statically or loaded dynamically.</li></ul>
<p>
When considering this configuration, take into account that multi-DLL Pin tool may increase memory fragmentation and cause layout conflicts with application images. If there is no compelling reasons for using multiple DLLs, build your tool as a single DLL to reduce the risk of memory conflicts.<p>
Limitations and instructions:<ul>
<li>Don't use any Pin API in "secondary DLLs". Only "main DLL" can use Pin API!</li><li>Use one of the following methods to load "secondary DLLs":<ul>
<li>statically link "secondary DLLs" to the "main DLL"</li><li>dynamically load "secondary DLLs" in the main() function of "main DLL". Do not load DLLs in instrumentation/analysis callbacks - it is unsafe!</li></ul>
</li><li>If necessary, unload "secondary DLLs" in the main() function of "main DLL". Do not unload DLLs in instrumentation/analysis callbacks - it is unsafe!</li><li>IMPORTANT: Build each DLL with the recommended pin tool building flags (see <a class="el" href="index.html#building">Building tools for kit in different versions of Visual Studio</a>).</li><li>Remove /EXPORT:main link flag for "secondary DLLs".</li><li>Specify different base address for each DLL (/BASE link flag). When choosing base addresses, try to minimize memory fragmentation and layout conflicts.</li></ul>

Introduction</a></h3>
The Linux version of pin requires the shared objects from glibc:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
libc
libm
libdl
ld-linux*
</pre></div><p>
and g++ libraries:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
libstdc++
libgcc_s
</pre></div><p>
and the following additional libraries:<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
libelf
libdwarf
</pre></div> If your system does not have the runtime libraries required for gcc3.4 or later(/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6), then we recommend that you install them. Installing the compiler will install the runtime libraries. If that is not possible, then we provide the libraries and a method to use them from a local directory. If you want to use a probe based tool, then you cannot use the default glibc that comes with recent linux distributions. We provide the libraries and a method to use them from a local directory.<h3><a class="anchor" name="COMPILERS_LINUX">
Linux Compiler Requirements</a></h3>
Pin tools on Linux are shared objects loaded by pin before the application starts. Pin and the tool share the runtime libraries therefore the tool must be compiled with a compiler compatible with Pin. Pin is compiled by GCC 4.4.7 and is tested regularly with tools compiled with various GCC versions ranging from version 3.4.6 to version 4.6.2.<h3><a class="anchor" name="LIBRARIES_NO_PROBE">
How to Install Libraries If You Do Not Use Probe-mode</a></h3>
If you do not use probe mode, no additional steps are required. The Pin kit comes with all the necessary runtime libraries built-in.<p>
The file "pin" is a small c-based launcher executable that will set up the environment to find the libraries supplied with the kit. The kit's runtime directories will be searched first, followed by directories that are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The launcher will then invoke the actual Pin executable called "pinbin".<p>
If you need to change the directory structure or copy pin to a different directory, then you must understand the following. The file "pin" is a simple launcher that expects the binary "pinbin" to be in the architecture-specific "bin" subdirectory (e.g. ia32/bin). The launcher expects the libraries to be found in the architecture-specific "runtime" and subdirectory (i.e. ia32/runtime). If you need a different directory structure, you need to build your own launcher or find a different way to set up the environment to allow the pinbin executable to find the necessary runtime libraries. The pinbin binary itself makes no assumptions about the directory structure.<p>
If your native system libraries are newer than the ones supplied with the kit, they will be used instead, so you can always use the latest version of gcc.<h3><a class="anchor" name="LIBRARIES_PROBE">
How To Install Libraries If You Use Probe-mode</a></h3>
If you are using probe mode, you cannot use the standard glibc on your system. You need to install pin-probe-runtime.tar.gz. This file can be downloaded from <em><a href="http://www.pintool.org">http://www.pintool.org</a></em>.<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
tproj&gt; tar zxf pin-probe-runtime.tar.gz
</pre></div><p>
The pin launcher (described in the section above) expects to find glibc in the architecture-specific "runtime" subdirectory (i.e. ia32/runtime), so be careful about rearranging files and directories.<h3><a class="anchor" name="BUILD_PROBES_TOOLS_ON_LINUX">
How to build tools for Probe-mode on Linux</a></h3>
Backward compatibility in libraries in Linux is achieved by using version-symbols. New versions of glibc and the standard C++ runtime libraries have backward compatibility. The pin-probe-runtime includes glibc 2.3.4 and a version of C++ runtime libraries that can be used with this version of glibc.<p>
The simplest way to be compatible with this version of glibc is to install red hat el4 or one of its clones (e.g. centos) and use the system compiler. It is also possible to build a tool on newer Linux OS releases, as long as the tool does not reference symbols that are not in glibc 2.3.4. If there is a problem, you will get an error message about not being able to find symbols when starting pin.<h3><a class="anchor" name="LIBRARIES_PACKAGING">
Packaging Pintools For a Binary Distribution</a></h3>
If you are distributing pin tools in binary form, then we suggest that you preserve the layout of the kit's runtime directories.<p>
The "ia32" subdirectory is used for the IA-32 architecture. Similarly, "intel64" is used for the Intel(R) 64 architecture.<p>
======================================================================================== <h2><a class="anchor" name="INSTALLATION">
Installing Pin</a></h2>
========================================================================================<p>
Each kit contains Pin and libraries for a specific architecture. Make sure the kit you download is for the right architecture. The Pin libraries use C++, and the compiler you use to build the tool must be compatible with the Pin library. This restriction only applies to building tools; you can instrument applications built by any compiler.<p>
See the README file in the kit for specific information about compiler version and other limitations. If your compiler is not compatible with the kit, send mail to <a href="mailto:pinheads@yahoogroups.com">pinheads@yahoogroups.com</a>.<p>
To install a kit, unpack a kit and change to the directory.<p>
Linux / OSX / Android: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ tar zxf pin-2.12-56759-gcc.4.4.7-linux.tar.gz
$ cd pin-2.12-56759-gcc.4.4.7-linux
</pre></div> Use the OSX / Android kit names respectively.<p>
Windows: Unzip the installation files, extracting all files in the kit. <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
$ cd  pin-2.12-56759-msvc10-windows.zip
</pre></div> Use the kit for the Visual Studio version you're using.<h3><a class="anchor" name="OSX_PERMISSIONS">
How to run pin on OSX</a></h3>
The pin executable is signed with an Intel code sign certificate, requiring the use of the "system.privilege.taskport" priviledge. The OS requires the user consent for pin to use this interface.<br>
 If you are working on the graphical environment of the OS, you will be prompt for your username and password.<br>
 If you are working from a terminal without access to the graphical environment, you can do one of the following:<br>
 1. In the terminal type: security authorize -l -c system.privilege.taskport<br>
 2. Edit the /etc/authorization file manually and set the "system.privilege.taskport" property value to allow.<br>
 3. (2) can be achieved by entering the following line in the terminal: sudo security authorizationdb write system.privilege.taskport allow<br>
 NOTICE: (2) and (3) are permanent and will allow all users and processes to use the taskport privilege, which is considered a security risk.<br>

<h3><a class="anchor" name="MakefileUsage">
Using Pin's makefile Infrastructure</a></h3>
Pintools are built using make on all target platforms. This section describes the basic flags available in Pin's makefile infrastructure. This is not a makefile tutorial. For general information about makefiles, refer to the makefile manual available at <em><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html</a></em>.<h3><a class="anchor" name="ConfigDirectory">
The Config Directory</a></h3>
The source/tools/Config directory holds the common make configuration files which should not be changed and template files which may serve as a basis for your own makefiles. This sections gives a short overview of the most notable files in the directory. The experienced user is welcome to read through the complete set of configuration files for better understanding the tools' build process.<p>
<code>makefile.config</code>: This is the first file to be included in the make include chain. It holds documentation of all the relevant flags and variables available to users, both within the makefile and from the command shell. Also, this file includes the OS-specific configuration files.<p>
<code>makefile.unix.config</code>: This file holds the Unix definitions of the makefile variables. See <code>makefile.win.config</code> for the Windows definitions.<p>
<code>unix.vars</code>: This file holds the Unix definitions of some architectural variables and utilities used by the makefiles. See <code>win.vars</code> for the Windows definitions.<p>
<code>makefile.default.rules</code>: This file holds the default make targets, test recipes and build rules.<h3><a class="anchor" name="TestDirectories">
The Test Directories</a></h3>
Each test directory in source/tools/ contains two files in the makefile chain.<p>
<code>makefile</code>: This is the makefile which will be invoked when running make. This file should not be changed. It holds the include directives for all the relevant configuration files of the makefile chain in the correct order. Changing this order may result in unexpected behavior. This is a generic file, it is identical in all test directories.<p>
<code>makefile.rules</code>: This is the directory-specific makefile. It holds the logic of the current directory. All tools, applications and tests that should be built and run in a directory are defined in this file. See <a class="el" href="index.html#AddingTests">Adding Tests, Tools and Applications to the makefile</a> for adding tests, tools and applications to makefile.rules.<h3><a class="anchor" name="AddingTests">
Adding Tests, Tools and Applications to the makefile</a></h3>
This section describes how to define your applications, tools and tests in the makefile. The sections below describe how to build the binaries and how to run the tests.<p>
The variables detailed below, hold the tests, applications and tools definitions. They are defined in the "Test targets" section of makefile.rules. See this section for additional variables and more detailed documentation for each variable.<p>
<code>TOOL_ROOTS</code>: Define the name of your tool here, without the file extension. The correct extension, according to the OS, will be added automatically by make. For example, for adding YourTool.so: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
TOOL_ROOTS := YourTool
</pre></div><p>
<code>APP_ROOTS</code>: Define your application here, without the file extension. The correct extension according to the OS, will be added automatically by make. For example, for adding YourApp.exe: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
APP_ROOTS := YourApp
</pre></div><p>
<code>TEST_ROOTS</code>: Define your tests here without the .test suffix. This suffix will be added automatically by make. For example, for adding YourTest.test: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
TEST_ROOTS := YourTest
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="DefiningbuildRules">
Defining Build Rules for Tools and Applications</a></h3>
Default build rules for tools and applications are defined in source/tools/Config/makefile.default.rules. The default tool requires a single c/cpp source file and will generate a tool of the same name. For example, for YourTool.cpp make will generate YourTool.so with the default build rule. However, if your tool requires more than one source file, or you need a customized build rule, add your rule at the bottom of makefile.rules in the "Build rules" section". There is no need to add the $(OBJDIR) dependency to the build rule, it will be added automatically. This dependency creates the build output directory obj-intel64 (or obj-ia32 for the IA-32 architecture). See source/tools/Config/makefile.config for all available compilation and link flags.<p>
Here are a few useful examples:<p>
Building an unoptimized tool from a single source: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
# Build the intermediate object file.
$(OBJDIR)YourTool$(OBJ_SUFFIX): YourTool.cpp
    $(CXX) $(TOOL_CXXFLAGS_NOOPT) $(COMP_OBJ)$@ $&lt;

# Build the tool as a dll (shared object).
$(OBJDIR)YourTool$(PINTOOL_SUFFIX): $(OBJDIR)YourTool$(OBJ_SUFFIX)
    $(LINKER) $(TOOL_LDFLAGS_NOOPT) $(LINK_EXE)$@ $&lt; $(TOOL_LPATHS) $(TOOL_LIBS)
</pre></div><p>
Building an optimized tool from several source files: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
# Build the intermediate object file.
$(OBJDIR)Source1$(OBJ_SUFFIX): Source1.cpp
    $(CXX) $(TOOL_CXXFLAGS) $(COMP_OBJ)$@ $&lt;

# Build the intermediate object file.
$(OBJDIR)Source2$(OBJ_SUFFIX): Source2.c Source2.h
    $(CC) $(TOOL_CXXFLAGS) $(COMP_OBJ)$@ $&lt;

# Build the tool as a dll (shared object).
$(OBJDIR)YourTool$(PINTOOL_SUFFIX): $(OBJDIR)Source1$(OBJ_SUFFIX) $(OBJDIR)Source2$(OBJ_SUFFIX) Source2.h
    $(LINKER) $(TOOL_LDFLAGS_NOOPT) $(LINK_EXE)$@ $(^:%.h=) $(TOOL_LPATHS) $(TOOL_LIBS)
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="DefiningTestRecipes">
Defining Test Recipes in makefile.rules</a></h3>
A default test recipe is defined in source/tools/Config/makefile.default.rules. For most users, this recipe is insufficient. You may specify your own test recipes in makefile.rules in the "Test recipes" section. There is no need to add the $(OBJDIR) dependency to the build rule, it will be added automatically. This dependency creates the build output directory obj-intel64 (or obj-ia32 for the IA-32 architecture).<p>
Example: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
YourTest.test: $(OBJDIR)YourTool$(PINTOOL_SUFFIX) $(OBJDIR)YourApp$(EXE_SUFFIX)
    $(PIN) -t $&lt; -- $(OBJDIR)YourApp$(EXE_SUFFIX)
</pre></div><h3><a class="anchor" name="UsefulVariables">
Useful make Variables and Flags</a></h3>
For a complete list of all the available variables and flags, see source/tools/Config/makefile.config . Here is a short list of the most useful flags: <br>
<code>PIN_ROOT</code>: Specify the location for the Pin kit when building a tool outside of the kit. <br>
<code>CC</code>: Override the default c compiler for tools. <br>
<code>CXX</code>: Override the default c++ compiler for tools <br>
<code>APP_CC</code>: Override the default c compiler for applications. If not defined, APP_CC will be the same as CC. <br>
<code>APP_CXX</code>: Override the default c++ compiler for applications. If not defined, APP_CXX will be the same as CXX. <br>
<code>TARGET</code>: Override the default target architecture e.g. for cross-compilation. <br>
<code>ICC</code>: Specify ICC=1 when building tools with the Intel Compiler. <br>
<code>DEBUG</code>: When DEBUG=1 is specified, debug information will be generated when building tools and applications. Also, no compilation and/or link optimizations will be performed. <br>
<code>PROBE</code>: Specifying PROBE=1 enables the probe-mode tests.<p>
